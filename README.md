****** About this model ******
It is a trained machine learning model for classifying images of flowers into categories such as daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip. The model is saved in a file, as are similar images for each category. Indeed, it predicts the type of flower in a photo user upload and can display images of similar flowers from its dataset. This helps provide a visual reference for the predicted category of flowers.
